FSU Innovation Internship Site

What this Project is:
This is a website where students can apply for internships and create profiles that employers can see.
Employers can post positions that their companies offer for students to find.

How to use it:
If you are a Student, then you will need to create a profile. After that, employers will know all about you when you are looking for the internship you desire.
If you are a Employer, create a profile of yourself and the company you represent where you can post projects available at your company.
