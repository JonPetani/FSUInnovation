<h1>Rules/Policies for the FSU Innovation Internship Website</h1>
<div class='txt'>
<h2>Terms of Service/Usage of our Website</h2>
<p>As with any service like us, we have certain policies both our student intern and company rep. members must follow when using our site. Listed below are rules/policies that should always be followed. Failure to heed these conditions could lead to the revoking of privileges, account termination, and notification to law enforcement where applicable.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Do not do anything illegal</dt>
<dd>If there is something you want to submit/post that may apply to this rule, contact a administrator to see if the content is acceptable. Our laws apply to those of the United States and the State of Massachusetts.</dd>
<dt>Similiarly, do not do anything offensive</dt>
<dd>Don't post anything in our discussion board or edit your account in a way that offends people. If someone contacts an administrator related to such content, we will first ask you to take it down if possible, and will delete it ourselves if you don't comply.</dd>
<dt>Only one account per user</dt>
<dd>In order to combat spamming, fishing, hacking, and unwanted advertising, we ask that all users only have one account. If we suspect that a user has more than one account on our site, we will delete all of that's user's accounts and ban them from creating new ones.</dd>
<dt>All content on this site belongs to the FSU Innovation Center</dt>
<dd>If you wish to use content from our site on one of yours, contact a administrator to ask for permission.</dd>
</dl><hr>
<h3>Students/Interns</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Make sure that all information on your account is legitimate</dt>
<dd>In order to maintain the integrity of our services of connecting employers and students, we ask that all students who create accounts post real information and not fake information. If too many students post fake information, it makes our website look unprofessional and we may need to delete said account to protect our integrity.</dd>
<dt>Also do not try to impersonate another student</dt>
<dd>This goes along with our legal policies. If we suspect a student account is there to impersonate another person, we will take action.</dd>
<dt>The rules in General are especially relevant to you</dt>
<dd>You are a student looking for a internship. Just remember if you do something that is questionable on our site, employers will see this mistake and it could hurt your professional career in the future.</dd>
</dl><hr>
<h3>Members/Company Reps</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Keep job descriptions consistant</dt>
<dd>If we find out your company is not following through with your job description when hiring the interns and keeping a consistant standard as found on our site, we may delete posts that are misleading to students in such a case. Our site does not tolerate scams of any kind.</dd>
<dt>Keep jobs posted consistant with the laws</dt>
<dd>The types of positions you post should comply with the applicable laws in regards to the students who apply for them.</dd>
<dt>Be sure you are a legitimate hirer</dt>
<dd>If we find that you or your organization isn't legitimate, we will delete you from the site without question</dd>
<dt>Keep company and job descriptions as detailed as possible</dt>
<dd>Vague descriptions will confuse potential interns and will make it harder to find the candidate(s) you are looking for. If a position seems too arbitrary without a way for the student to contact you for details, we may delete said job from the site to keep our content relevant.</dd>
